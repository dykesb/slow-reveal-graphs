This folder contains all R scripts and output for special request plots. Plots were generated using code from Sydney Meyer ([GitHub](https://github.com/meyesydn/Slow-Reveal)). Alex Gichuki contributed as well.

Not all plots from Sydney's repo appear here since some are recreated more completely in another folder on this repo. File numbering is done in no particular order.
